title: How To Use Quarry
---

**Step 1:** Select a Rewarder

The first thing you will have to do is select a Rewarder on the _Browse Rewarders_ page.

This opens a _Rewarder Page_, which includes all the Quarries available for you to stake into & receive that rewarder's token (for example, Soluna).

**Step 2:** Select a Quarry

Different Quarries offer different APY's which are calculated based on:

- Total value staked in the Primary Quarry's base token (for example, $ amount of Saber UST-solUST LP).
- Total daily emissions $ amount across value staked.
- Assumes rate would remain the same over the course of 1 year.

**In reality these rates change as users move in and out of Quarries, and rewarders fund new rewards & others end their rewards. It is important to select a Quarry in which you have a favorable outlook on the token being staked as well as the token used for rewards.**

Let's say you select the Saber UST-solUST LP which provides ~15% APY with two tokens tokens.

**Step 3:** Connect your wallet and deposit the Quarry's required token. In our example this would be a Saber UST-solUST LP token which we can acquire by depositing liquidity to saber.

**Step 4:** Claim rewards.
