title: Upcoming Quarry Features
---

## Overview

**Quarry Protocol** is designed to offer a general-purpose mining program for other protocols to build on top off. In order to continue offering useful functions to these protocols & our users - Quarry v2 will include more creative implementations of staking & open tooling for DAOs to make use of. We also have a vision to become a DAO once we have a well established community.

**Roadmap**

1. Streamline the Rewarder **self-onboarding** process.
2. Launch **Bribe market** for gauges, with self-onboarding for Tribeca-compatible DAOs.
3. Integrate Bribe mechanism beyond gauges to **all proposals on Tribeca**.
4. Launch Quarry DAO to manage platform approval procedures, fees, & hires employees to manage future protocol development.
