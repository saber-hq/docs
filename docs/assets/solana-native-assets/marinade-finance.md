## About

[Marinade Finance](https://marinade.finance) is a Liquid staking protocol on Solana. Liquid staking is an alternative to traditional staking: it allows users to stake any amount of SOL and to effectively unstake their SOL without the requirement of waiting 1-3 days before the stake is warmed up or cooled down. Warming up or cooling down stake normally takes around \~3 days.

mSOL is a liquid stake pool token. The risks include Marinade delegated validators being dishonest and getting their SOL slashed when slashing is implemented on mainnet. Read more about Marinade's staking algorithm in [their documentation. ](https://docs.marinade.finance)
