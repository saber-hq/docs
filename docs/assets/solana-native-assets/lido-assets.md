## About

This means that you can deposit SOL with LIDO, let them stake the SOL with various validators to earn interest, and gain capital efficiency using the stSOL stake pool token to reprsent your deposit. The risks involved include Lido delegated validators being dishonest and having their SOL slashed when slashing is implemented on mainnet.&#x20;
