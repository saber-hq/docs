# Listing on Saber

Anyone can create a Saber pool: Saber is a permissionless protocol.

However, getting featured on the web app and being added to gauges requires additional steps. This is because Saber only lists stable pairs: assets must be verified to be relatively stable before being pushed to users.

To get your asset listed on Saber, perform the following steps:

1. Add your token to [the official Solana token list](https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list).
2. Submit a pull request to [the Saber Governance repo](https://github.com/saber-hq/governance), editing `Sources.toml` and `assets/Mainnet.toml`. If you are non-technical, you may also [create a ticket here](https://github.com/saber-hq/governance/issues/new?assignees=macalinao%2Cmichaelhly%2Cdyljm1&labels=asset&template=new-asset.md&title=%5BASSET%5D).
