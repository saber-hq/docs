# Introduction

## What is Saber?

Saber is an automated market maker and liquidity pool on [Solana](https://solana.com) designed for extremely efficient trading between similarly priced (pegged) assets, without an opportunity cost.

This trading activity results in fees for providers of liquidity, resulting in a safer, lower-risk staking opportunity representing real world transaction volume.

## Asset Types

Saber generally allows for trading between assets that mean revert in price. There are several assets that Saber specializes in:

- **USD Stablecoins.** There are hundreds of dollar-based stablecoins in existence, ranging from dollar-backed stablecoins like [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) and [Tether](https://tether.to/), decentralized stablecoins such as [UST](https://terra.money/), and native Solana stablecoins such as [Cashio](https://cashio.app).
- **Bridged assets.** There are a large number of bridges that lead to Solana, and Saber is the primary liquidity source to exchange between the different bridged assets. One example is the [renBTC-BTC](https://app.saber.so/#/pools/btc/deposit) pool, which allows swapping between the [Ren](https://renproject.io/) and [FTX](https://ftx.com) versions of Bitcoin. Many stablecoins are also bridged assets; Saber is the primary way for Solana users to navigate between different chains.
- **Staking derivatives.** Saber is the largest venue for trading SOL staking derivatives such as [Marinade SOL](https://marinade.io) and [Lido SOL](https://lido.fi).
