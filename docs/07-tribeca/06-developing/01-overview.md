title: Building on Tribeca
---

## General Principles

Tribeca is designed from the ground up to be modular and extensible. It consists of two hard-coded standards: the [Smart Wallet](../goki/smart-wallet) and the [Governor](../governor/overview).

### Rust Documentation

All programs in Tribeca are open source and documented inline. [View the list of programs here.](./programs)
