title: Tribeca DAO
---

Tribeca is an open source governance primitive built and maintained by the Tribeca DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) consisting of members of Solana's leading protocols. The DAO consists of members of Solana's leading protocols. At the time of writing, all programs are currently owned by the Tribeca DAO Smart Wallet.

There is currently a plan to migrate the program ownership to the Saber DAO.

All programs are deployed on `mainnet-beta` and `devnet` and are verified on the [Anchor verified build system](https://anchor.projectserum.com/).
