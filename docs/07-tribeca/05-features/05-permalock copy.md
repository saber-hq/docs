Permalocks are vote escrows which are always locked to the maximum duration.

They works by allowing any user to refresh the lockup period of the vote escrow to the maximum period, ensuring that the owner of the Permalock can never unstake the tokens. Since the Tribeca DAO holds the program upgrade keys, a DAO can be certain that a permalock will never be unlocked, ever.

Permalocks are very useful for DAO-to-DAO governance, as they provide a simple way to delegate control to an account which manages governance on behalf of a DAO.
