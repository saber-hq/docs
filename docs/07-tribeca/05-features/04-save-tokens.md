The **Simple Agreement for Vote-Escrowed Tokens**, i.e. the **SAVE**, is a derivative which enforces that when locking DAO tokens, those tokens must be staked for a minimum duration.

SAVEs help to reduce sell pressure from grants and ensure that SAVE recipients are aligned longer-term. As they are separate tokens from the main DAO token, they do not have the same liquidity as the main DAO token and as a result are harder to dump.

For maximal composability, SAVEs are fully transferrable SPL tokens. To prevent SAVEs from being traded, one can use a lockup system such as [Venko](https://venko.app).
